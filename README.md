# The Distance

A collaborative, whitelisted Minecraft server. The goal is to stick as close to
Vanilla as possible in a multiplayer environment.

## Guidelines

- Focused on exploration/building.
- Only consentual PvP.
- No griefing, no stealing.
- Treat others with respect.

## Server details

- Minecraft 1.16.1
- Paper

## Plugins

- Morpheus
- Dynmap

## Config changes

While we try to stay as closely to Vanilla as sensible, we've made the following
changes to improve our gaming experience:

- Fires don't spread
- Hard difficulty
