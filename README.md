# The Distance

Vanilla as possible in a multiplayer environment.

## Plugins

## Config changes

While we try to stay as closely to Vanilla as sensible, we've made the following
changes to improve our gaming experience:

- Hard difficulty - We want those zombie-converted villagers.
- Fires don't spread - No one wants their build ruined by a random lightning
  strike.
- Only one player needs to sleep to skip the night - this is as close to the
  singleplayer experience as possible.
